## 1 Pager - Due Oct 16
1. The project description should be 1 page and a pdf document.
2. It should present a clear outline of the problem statement, dataset description, goals, and timeline of the project.

## Down the line: 
3. Action Plan which addresses (and is submitted with project)
- Describing the problem scientifically  
- Background study (literature review or related work)  
- Dataset Understanding and Exploratory Data Analysis  
- Developing Accurate Prediction Model(s)  
- Evaluation of the model(s) and Testing the performance  
- Developing a basic web-based front-end to invoke and run the model(s) on input data and display the prediction output  

End of Quarter Report should include
•Introduction and background (1 page)
•Literature review (1/2 page)
•Dataset Description and exploratory data analysis of the dataset (1-2 page)
•Proposed methodology (1 page)
•Experimental results (2-3 pages)
•Conclusion and discussion -- you can include the project roadmap here too (1/2 page)
•References (no limit)

- In the final report, include visualizations, tables, and plots in your report to show trends and report the performance and training of the model.
- Figures need to have explanatory captions that explain the trend in them.
- Plots should also be used during exploratory data analysis. (here is a guide: https://towardsdatascience.com/a-gentle-introduction-to-exploratory-data-analysis-f11d843b8184 )  
- In the final report, reference figures properly in the report.  
- In the final report, related work (or background or literature review) section, review related published papers with methodology which may help or inspire your research project. For instance, the dataset they used, or the selection of techniques they studied. You need to indicate how your work is different from these past works.  
- In the final report, include your findings in the conclusion section.
