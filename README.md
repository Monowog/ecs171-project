https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/asdasdasasdas/garbage-classification

The goal of this project is to accurately classify photos of trash into paper, glass, metal, cardboard, plastic, and trash (other).
We built 3 different models:
## 1. Support Vector Machine (SVM)
## 2. Random Forest 
## 3. Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
Each of which has been uploaded here. Additionally, we included a the code for a webpage that runs the CNN, the code used for exploratory data analysis, as well as the dataset itself.
