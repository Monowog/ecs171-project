# Garbage Classification 
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/asdasdasasdas/garbage-classification

The goal of this project is to accurately classify photos of trash into paper, glass, metal, cardboard, plastic, and trash (other).
All data is in archive, and source code can be run 'as is' with installation of required modules as described below. 
- matplotlib, numpy, joblib, scikit-image, seaborn, pandas, scikit-learn, tensorflow
To install them all at once run this: 
pip install matplotlib numpy joblib scikit-image seaborn pandas scikit-learn tensorflow

We built 3 different models:
## 1. Support Vector Machine (SVM)
## 2. Random Forest
## 3. Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
Each of which has been uploaded here. Additionally, we included the code for a webpage that runs the CNN, the code used for exploratory data analysis, as well as the dataset itself. 
## Exploratory Data Analysis
This file includes any analysis and figures relevant to our EDA process.
